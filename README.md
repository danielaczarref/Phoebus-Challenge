# Phoebus Challenge - Recruitment and Selection

This app consists in the development of an app to consume Marvel's API to display its contents in a e-commerce mobile application.

It's still not done yet :/ but hopefully I'll finish the front-end display of contents asap. All my hardwork recently was focused on consuming Marvel's API.

## Main Challenges
- Java: although I'm passionate about Java an OOP, it's been a long while since I've programmed in Java. So I was kinda rusty;
- Android Studio: it's been loooooooong while since I had to use Android Studio for programming. Over the past few years, I've been used to program in React Native framework and forgot a LOT about Android Studio frontend. Not proud of this but it is the truth.

## TODO
- To finish the integration of the API's contents on the front-end array list i've already prepared to receive a thumbnail, comics' title and its description. It's just a matter of testing harder and finding the time :/
